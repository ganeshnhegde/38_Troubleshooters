  <p><b>Don't give up:</b>You may feel hopeless right now. You may feel like you're never going to get better. But feeling that way is a symptom of your condition. If you give yourself some time and allow your treatment to take effect, you will feel better again.</p>
  <p><b>Express yourself:</b>Exercise your imagination (painting, drawing, doodling, sewing, writing, dancing, composing music, etc.) and you not only get those creative juices flowing, you also loosen up some positive emotions.Take time to play with a friend or a pet, or do something fun for yourself.</p>
  <p><b>Try to notice good things:</b>Try to notice one thing, then try to think of one more. Consider your strengths, gifts, or blessings.</p>
